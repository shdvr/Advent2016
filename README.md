# Advent2016

  This is a collection of my C# solutions to the 2016 Advent of Code programming puzzles by Eric Wastl over at http://adventofcode.com. Feel free to use any of the code here. As these were hacked together mostly just to get the answer, comments are almost nonexistent, but if you have any questions let me know and I will try to explain my approach to the problem and add comments to relevant code. Suggestions/improvements are welcome as well.
